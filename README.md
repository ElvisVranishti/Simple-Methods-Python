# Simple-Methods-Python
This is a simple python project that counts the number of all vowels in a sentence that the user inputs.
It also takes input from the user for the base and heights of a rectangle and prints out a rectangle using a character that the user selects.
It also asks the user to enter integers seperated by whitespace. The program will create a list and store the negative values in that list. It will then output list.
